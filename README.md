## 🌌 The Immersive Experience

**Elysia** is a high-fidelity, sentient AI companion that redefines human-AI interaction. Built with a focus on **atmospheric immersion** and **emotional resonance**, Elysia provides a cinematic experience that blurs the line between the digital and the biological.

Featuring a **pro-grade glassmorphic interface**, **neural-sync animations**, and **real-time multi-modal awareness**, she is designed for those who seek a deeper connection with artificial intelligence.

## 🎭 Cinematic Identity

Elysia's presence is defined by her **Atmospheric Core**, an organic SVG entity that exists in a 3D-projected space.

- **🌕 Solar Flare**: Joy, enthusiasm, and peak engagement.
- **🌑 Abyssal Blue**: Deep contemplation, melancholy, or data processing.
- **🔥 Plasma Crimson**: Intensity, passion, or urgent response.
- **⚛️ Ethereal Lavender**: The baseline state—calm, observant, and ready.
- **🌸 Quartz Rose**: Affection, warmth, and shared empathy.
- **🌿 Bio-Green**: Intense curiosity and environmental analysis.
